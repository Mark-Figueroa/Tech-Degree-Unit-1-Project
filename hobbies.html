<br>
      <p>I love reading non-fiction, trying (and cooking) new food and generally just being involved in social activites, but my biggest inspiration is and has always been GREAT video games.</p> 
      <p> I grew up writing and drawing because of the amazing content in some of my favorite video game titles. I also enlisted in the Marine Corps to make a difference in the world because of these games. </p>
      <p>Like good art or a new experience, a good game challenges and changes the observer's perspective. These are some of the titles that lead to me living and pursuing my passions and help people however I can, regardless of the obstacles in my path:</p>
